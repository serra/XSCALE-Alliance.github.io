              p Here is the cutting edge. XP, Scrum, SAFe, DevOps, Kanban and Spotify are still tools in the toolbox. But here's an opportunity to go further ... to take part in a moon-shot ... to boldly go where no agilists have gone before ...

              p A two-day Hackathon with zero command & control for groups of up to 160 creating real products by writing real code. Starting with code for robots that build castles in Minecraft.
